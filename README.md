# Calculator 1.0
This is the code for a simple calculator program I wrote. the code gets run in the terminal, will ask you for numbers and operators, and then perform the operations whenever you type in an equal sign
I also added the prototype for the calculator
it's much simpler and only takes 3 inputs. two numbers and an operator
